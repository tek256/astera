Astera is a game library focused on performance, portability, and maintainability. Astera aims to rely on as few dependencies as possible.  

## Building
Astera and it's dependencies are built using CMake. You can run your own CMake command or try using one of the automated build scripts.
```
Usage build_unix.sh && build_win.bat [-hrcxqq]
-h  Show this info
-r  Build release (optimizations, -O2)
-c  Build clean (remove previous build generated by this script)
-x  Don't build examples
-q  Quiet output
-qq Silence all output
Windows Only:
-m  Force use MinGW (gcc/g++)
-l  Force use LLVM (clang/clang++)
```

Example script usage:
```
./build_unix.sh -r // Generate release candidate
```

Example CMake usage:
```
cmake -Bbuilld -S. -DASTERA_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```
