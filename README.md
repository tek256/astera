### About
Astera is a game library focused on performance, portability, and maintainability. Astera aims to rely on as few dependencies as possible.  

#### Latest Release: 0.01  

### Target Platforms
Here are the target platforms for this library:  
```
- Windows
- Linux
- Mac OSX (versions supporting OpenGL 3.3+)
- BSD
``` 

_NOTE: I'm always open to adding more target platforms!_

### Libraries Used
[GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw), [OpenAL-Soft](https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft), [GLAD](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad), [STB](https://github.com/nothings/stb/) Image & Vorbis, [nanovg](https://github.com/memononen/nanovg), and [ZIP](https://github.com/kuba--/zip).

### Building
Astera and it's dependencies are built using CMake. You can run your own CMake command or try using one of the automated build scripts (they're located in the `tools/` folder).

```
Usage build_unix.sh && build_win.bat [-hrcxqq]
-h  Show this info
-r  Build release (optimizations, -O2)
-c  Build clean (remove previous build generated by this script)
-x  Don't build examples
-q  Quiet output
-qq Silence all output
Windows Only:
-m  Force use MinGW (gcc/g++)
-l  Force use LLVM (clang/clang++)
```

Example script usage (generate a release candidate):

```
./build_unix.sh -r
```

Example CMake usage:

```
cmake -Bbuilld -S. -DASTERA_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release # Generate the build files
cmake --build build # Build the build files
```

For more information see the relevant [wiki page](http://tek256.com/astera/_build/html/Build%20Guide.html) or the `docs/Build Guide.rst` file.
